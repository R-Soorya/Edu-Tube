# Learnify: Context-Aware Question Answering System

Learnify is a project designed to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-specific answers to user queries based on YouTube video transcripts. This tool ensures that responses are both relevant and accurate, refraining from answering questions that go beyond the video's context.

## Features

YouTube Transcript Integration: Extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and uses them as a knowledge base.

RAG Implementation: Combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the accuracy of answers.

Context-Aware Responses: Answers only when the user's query aligns with the video's content. Avoids generating responses for out-of-context queries.

Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly platform for question-answer interaction.

## How It Works

### Load Transcripts:

The transcript of a YouTube video is processed and stored in a searchable format.

### Question Input:

Users ask questions through the Streamlit interface.

### Answer Generation:

Relevant parts of the transcript are retrieved and used to generate a response using a generative model.

### Context Validation:

Ensures the question is within the video's context before generating an answer. If the query is out of context, a polite message is returned.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Learnify.git
cd Learnify

### Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

Access the application at http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Usage

Upload a YouTube video transcript or provide a URL to fetch the transcript.

Enter a question in the input box.

View the response generated by the system based on the video's context.

If the question is out of context, a message like "This question is beyond the context of the video." will be displayed.

## Technologies Used

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): For contextually accurate answers.

Streamlit: For creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Python Libraries: Including Langchain and more.
